addon_description=Jot Extension for Desktop and Mobile Firefox saves information about the current web page and any active text selection.\
\
These time-stamped entries can be downloaded as JSON or in user-defined file formats, preset to timeclock and csv format.\
\
Context menu entry on Android is only available on hyperlinks, because text selection is mutually exclusive with a context menu there.\
\
Syncing of Jot data works for Linux, OS X, Windows between browsers connected to the same Firefox Account.\
\
Various types of text selections (possibly multiple in Desktop browsers) properly preserve embedded newlines, e.g. MDN code samples
