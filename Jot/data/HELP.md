# Jot Firefox Add-on Help

also available in [Deutsch](HELP-de.md)

The Jot Firefox Add-on can be used to save information about the
current web page and any active text selection.

These time-stamped entries can be downloaded as JSON or in
user-defined file formats, preset to timeclock and csv format.

Syncing of Jot data works for Linux, OS X, Windows between browsers
connected to the same Firefox Account.

Various types of text selections (possibly multiple in Desktop
browsers) properly preserve embedded newlines, e.g. MDN code samples

It will pre-fill the editable textarea with text selections you make
prior to clicking ![Jot Logo](posts-48.png) and then the `Jot` menu
entry.

## Usage

Basic usage is described above.

Click the `Settings` menu entry to specify and save your own
customizations.

See the description under `Settings`.

A Help link is also provided, pointing to this user documentation.

## Feedback

You will be given the opportunity to open github issues (via clickable
notifications) when `Jot` detects problems or via the `Report Bugs,
Suggest Features` button in `Settings`.
